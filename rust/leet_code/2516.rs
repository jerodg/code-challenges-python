/// This module provides a solution to the problem of taking characters from a string
/// such that each character appears at least `k` times in the resulting substring.
impl Solution {
    /// Takes characters from the string `s` such that each character appears at least `k` times.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `s` - A string from which characters are taken.
    /// * `k` - An integer representing the minimum number of times each character should appear.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * An integer representing the minimum length of the substring that satisfies the condition.
    ///   Returns `-1` if it's not possible to satisfy the condition.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```
    /// let result = Solution::take_characters("aabbcc".to_string(), 2);
    /// assert_eq!(result, 6);
    /// ```
