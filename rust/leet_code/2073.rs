/// This struct provides a solution to calculate the time required to buy tickets.
///
/// The `Solution` struct contains a method to determine the total time required for a person
/// at position `k` in the queue to buy their tickets, given the number of tickets each person
/// in the queue wants to buy.
impl Solution {
    /// Calculates the time required for the person at position `k` to buy their tickets.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `tickets` - A vector of integers where each integer represents the number of tickets
    ///               each person in the queue wants to buy.
    /// * `k` - An integer representing the position (0-indexed) of the person in the queue.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * An integer representing the total time required for the person at position `k` to buy
    ///   their tickets.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```
    /// let tickets = vec![2, 3, 2];
    /// let k = 2;
    /// let result = Solution::time_required_to_buy(tickets, k);
    /// assert_eq!(result, 6);
